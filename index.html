        <h2>The Issue</h2>
        <p>Here’s some food for thought…2.5 billion tons of food are wasted globally every year. In America alone, we waste 60 million tons, equivalent to 120 billion pounds of food, with a value of 128 billion dollars. Most of this food ends up in landfills, producing methane, a gas more potent than carbon dioxide. However, about 6%-8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced if we stop wasting food.

        <h2>How Re-plate aims to solve this</h2>
        <p>Re-Plate aims to reduce food waste by connecting surplus food from restaurants, bakeries, and grocery stores with consumers at a discounted price. This is how it works: business owners can list unsold food items on the Re-plate app, and users receive real-time notifications where they can claim and reserve their order to be picked up or delivered. But what about food that has already been served to customers that they waste or food that is spoiled and cannot be sold? Re-plate connects businesses with local biorefineries where the food waste (good or bad) can be turned into clean energy. This creates a circular economy – a closed loop where food is either sold to customers or transformed into new energy, never ending up in landfills.</p>
